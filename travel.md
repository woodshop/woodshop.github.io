# Getting to Us

## Dartmouth Coach
The [Dartmouth Coach](http://www.dartmouthcoach.com/) has daily busses to/from New York and Boston. We have arranged the schedule so that it begins shortly after the first bus from NY arrives on Friday and ends shortly before the last bus to NY departs on Sunday. The Dartmouth Coach to/from New York requires reservations. We suggest that tickets are booked early (they may be cancelled up to a day before travel).

## Other
Other travel options include Amtrak (beware: the schedule is not very reliable), Greyhound, and Cape Air out of the Lebanon airport. We encourage participants to post on the wiki to offer or request car rides.

# Getting to/from Town/Venue
We will provide shuttles or some other means of transportation to/from the Dartmouth Coach bus stop and Pierce's Inn.
