<a name="about"></a>

The Digital Musics graduate program of the Dartmouth College Music Department is hosting a three day workshop from **October 10 to October 12, 2014** in rural New Hampshire.

The workshop is free and includes meals and lodging. This event is generously supported by [Dartmouth Digital Musics](http://digitalmusics.dartmouth.edu/masters-program/), the [Neukom Institute](http://neukom.dartmouth.edu/), and Dartmouth Film & Media Studies.

## Details
This workshop brings together **creative computer scientists, programmers, musicians, and visual artists** for a three day workshop on audio and visual synthesis methods. The workshop is located in a remote pastoral setting where the participants will have free reign to roam the grounds, take hikes, and gather by a campfire at night. During the days the workshop will include tutorials, a poster session, and roundtable discussions. The evenings will include performances by invited multimedia artists and collective *AV synthesis jams*.

We invite anyone with research interest in creative applications for audio or visual synthesis to register. The following topics might be included in the workshop (among others):

- Brain-media mappings
- Neural net based synthesizers
- Physical modeling
- Parametric models
- Data driven synthesis models and machine learning

Delicious meals and snacks will be catered by the inn. Lodging for 2 evenings will be provided.
