# Confirmed Workshops

## DAAT (Jason Hockman & Joseph Thibodeau)

<figure>

</figure>

DAAT is the collaboration of [Jason Hockman](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~hockman/) and [Joseph Thibodeau](http://www.idmil.org/people/joseph_thibodeau). Their practice applies their musical and academic knowledge to the creation of immersive sound experiences. Often dark and machinistic, their music navigates the borderlands between soundstage and dancefloor.

Jason Hockman recently completed a PhD at McGill University in Music Technology focusing on the ethnographic and technological aspects of breakbeats in Hardcore, Jungle and Drum & Bass. His research includes automatic beat tracking and rhythmic analysis as well as qualitative surveys and interviews with renowned producers and label owners. 

Joseph Thibodeau is a musician and researcher associated with McGill University's Music Technology area and Concordia University's Penhune Laboratory for Motor Learning and Neural Plasticity. His work centres mainly around new digital musical instruments, specifically augmented trumpets, which he designs for use in live performance and studio production.

[Carlos Dominguez](http://charlossound.wordpress.com/) works on a variety of different projects that involve chamber music, laptop performances, and sound installations. Most recently he has been interested in the uses of visible light in musical performances and compositions. He is currently a research assistant at Dartmouth College on a project with Jodie Mack.

### Description
Carlos will give a tutorial on making a hybrid digital/analog device for reading visible light data and discuss how it can be used for installation and performance art. In collaboration with Alexander Dupuis, the device will be incorporated into a performance at the Workshop in the Woods.

James Kerr is an animator who creates GIFs using Renaissance art and graphic illustrations. His humorous work treats subjects such as religion, class, entertainment, and modernism by juxtaposing Renaissance art with graphic depictions drawn from pop cultural references. [His work](http://scorpiondagger.com/) has been featured on [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/2014/08/04/the-amazing-renaissance-art-gi.html) and other blogs.

### Description

## Le Révélateur (Roger Tellier-Craig & Sabrina Ratté)

<figure>
	<a href="/images/revelateur.jpg"><img width="200" src="/images/revelateur.jpg" alt=""></a>
</figure>

[Le Révélateur started](http://le-revelateur.tumblr.com/) in 2008 as a solo venture for Montreal-based 
electronic musician Roger Tellier-Craig. It has since then expanded 
into an audio-visual duo with the inclusion of video artist [Sabrina 
Ratté](http://sabrinaratte.com/) in 2010. Together they explore a common fascination for the 
combination of electronic image and sound, using a varying array of 
digital and analogue technologies. They have performed together at 
various festivals across North America and Europe, including On 
Land festival (San Francisco), Mutek (Montreal), Mutek.Mx (Mexico 
City), Electric Fields (Ottawa), Micro Mutek (Barcelona), Suoni per Il 
Popolo (Montreal), Send+Receive (Winnipeg) and Tone Deaf 
(Kingston). 

Le Révélateur has released recordings on Gneiss Things and NNA 
Tapes, as well as a new LP on Root Strata entitled “Extreme Events” 
in early September 2014. 

### Description
Forthcoming.

## Jodie Mack

<figure>
	<a href="/images/mack.jpg"><img width="200" src="/images/mack.jpg" alt=""></a>
</figure>

[Jodie Mack](http://www.jodiemack.com/) is an experimental animator who received her MFA in film, video, and new media from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2007 and currently teaches animation at Dartmouth College. Combining the formal techniques and structures of abstract/absolute animation with those of cinematic genres, her handmade films use collage to explore the relationship between graphic cinema and storytelling, the tension between form and meaning. Musical documentary or stroboscopic archive: her films study domestic and recycled materials to illuminate the elements shared between fine-art abstraction and mass-produced graphic design. Questioning the role of decoration in daily life, the works unleash the kinetic energy of overlooked and wasted objects.

### Description 
She will lead a demonstration of optical sound 16mm projector drum circles, share historical gems, and lead discussions on the contemporary possibilities and problems of A/V synthesis.

## Kyle McDonald

[Kyle McDonald](http://kylemcdonald.net/) is a computational artist who is an active contributor to the [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) community. He has been a resident at CMU's [Frank-Ratchye Studio for Creative Inquiry](http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/) and is an Adjunct Professor at NYU's ITP.

### "Light Leaks"
["Light Leaks"](http://vimeo.com/66167082) is an immersive installation that uses mirror balls to reflect light from multiple projectors and cover the entirety of space. The mapping of every reflection is computed using a technique called structured light, which allows us to recover the 3d position and orientation of every reflection, as well as its origin in screen space. We will cover the general architecture of the system, including the calibration phase, and a brief discussion of related work and next steps.

## Scott Petersen

### Systems and Methods of Performative Synthesis: Considerations for Improvising with Code

This workshop will provide the attendee with an introduction to several systems and methods for improvising with code, focussing specifically on the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to live audio synthesis. The workshop will use the audio programming language SuperCollider for all examples, but the concepts are portable to other languages.

Key topics will include: data entry and interaction methods, communication protocols, language­specific goodies (UGens), one­liners, strengths and weaknesses of syntactic sugar, hardware considerations for real­time synthesis and more.

You may find it helpful to install SuperCollider before attending the workshop as example files, documentation and further reading will be provided beforehand.

## James Traer

James Traer is a postdoctoral researcher at Josh McDermott's [Laboratory for Computational Audition](http://mcdermottlab.mit.edu/). He is a physicist and oceanographer whose prior work focused on extracting information from ambient noise in the ocean and Earth's crust. He is currently at MIT studying acoustic reverberation.

### Synthesis of realistic (and wildly unrealistic) sounding impulse responses from environmental statistics.

Every room is different and hence has a set of unique impulse responses associated with each possible source-listener orientation.  However, the percept of reverberation may be similar across a wide range of rooms and configurations therein.  This suggests that the perceptually important features of reverberation may be independent of the details of the fine-structure of the impulse response (determined by the exact configuration and properties of the room) and rather may depend more strongly on the bulk statistics of the impulse response time series (determined by features such as room size and average reflectance of all surfaces).  We have measured real-world impulse responses in over 200 real-world spaces, both indoor and outdoor, including rooms large and small.  We have measured the statistics of these impulse responses and by imposing these statistics on Gaussian random noise we can quickly and easily synthesize realistic sounding reverberation.  Moreover, if we set our synthesis algorithm to intentionally violate the statistics we have measured in the real-world, the resulting “reverberant” signal sounds noticeably synthetic and unnatural.  This implies that the human brain uses the statistics of real-world impulse responses to separate signal arriving at the ear into contributions from the sound source and echoes from environmental reverberation.
