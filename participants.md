### Cameron Fraser

<figure>
	<a href="/images/fraser.png"><img width="200" src="/images/fraser.png" alt=""></a>
</figure>

[I](cameronfraser.bandcamp.com) attended Art Center College of Design for my undergraduate studies. There I focused on sculpture and new media. It was a visit by percussionist and sound arts pioneer Max Neuhaus that first opened my eyes to the possibilities of re-contextualizing and augmenting the environment through sound. This visit fundamentally changed my art practice.  Like Walter De Maria's Cricket Music and David Tudor's Rainforest, I too work in a conversation between natural and man made elements. My recent work explores the architecture of recorded sound. I am working with the microphone as a lens with which to frame space, time and narrative. In my work I blur the lines of field recording and to peer into the ephemera of the moment.

I have worked as a recording producer and engineer for several commercials and feature films such as the acclaimed documentary GMO OMG by Jeremy Seifert. I now pursue my MFA from Columbia’s Sound Arts program.  It has been a welcome and focused return to exploring the nature and possibilities of sound.
